== Usage

This plugin is shipped in a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD format], meaning it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or as a browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  title = require('bespoke-title');

bespoke.from('.deck', [
  title()
]);
```

When using a browser global:

```js
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  bespoke.plugins.title()
]);
```

=== Options

The following options are available when registering the bespoke-title plugin:

title _(type: string, default: document.title)_::
The title of the presentation, which appears after the title of the slide in the document's title.

separator _(type: string, default: ' â€” ')_::
The separator to place between the slide title and the presentation title in the document's title.
No additional spaces are added to this value.

==== Options example

Here's an example showing most of the options in use:

```
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  title({ title: 'Demo', separator: ': ' })
]);
```

== Behavior

This plugin updates the document title to match the slide title when each slide is activated.
The slide title is derived from either the `data-title` attribute on the slide or, if the `data-title` attribute is absent, the first `<h1>` or `<h2>` heading in the slide.
If the `data-title` attribute is present but empty, or there is no `<h1>` or `<h2>` heading in the slide, the document title reverts back to the presentation title.
